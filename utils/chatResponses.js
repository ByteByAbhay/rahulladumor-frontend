Monitoring**\n• CloudWatch Logs and Metrics\n• X-Ray for tracing\n• Custom dashboards\n• Alerts for errors and latency\n\n**💡 Pro Tips I've Learned:**\n\n**Cold Start Optimization:**\n• Keep functions small and focused\n• Use provisioned concurrency for critical paths\n• Minimize dependencies\n• Reuse connections (database, HTTP)\n\n**Cost Optimization:**\n• Right-size memory (more memory = faster = cheaper)\n• Use reserved concurrency wisely\n• Implement caching (API Gateway, Lambda)\n• Monitor and optimize hot paths\n\n**Security:**\n• Least privilege IAM roles\n• VPC for database access\n• Secrets Manager for credentials\n• API Gateway authorizers\n\n**🚀 Migration Path to Serverless:**\n\n**Phase 1: Start Small** (Month 1)\n• Migrate one simple API endpoint\n• Learn the patterns\n• Measure performance and cost\n\n**Phase 2: Expand** (Month 2-3)\n• Migrate more endpoints\n• Add event processing\n• Implement monitoring\n\n**Phase 3: Full Migration** (Month 4-6)\n• Migrate remaining services\n• Optimize performance\n• Train team\n\n**📈 Expected Results:**\n• **70-90% cost reduction**\n• **Infinite scaling** (within AWS limits)\n• **Zero server management**\n• **Faster deployments** (minutes vs hours)\n• **Better reliability** (AWS manages infrastructure)\n\n**🤔 Common Questions:**\n\n*"What about cold starts?"*\nWith proper optimization, cold starts are <100ms. For critical paths, use provisioned concurrency. Most users never notice.\n\n*"Can it handle high traffic?"*\nAbsolutely! I've built systems handling 10,000+ requests/second. Lambda scales automatically.\n\n*"What about databases?"*\nDynamoDB is perfect for serverless. For relational, Aurora Serverless works great.\n\n*"Is it really cheaper?"*\nFor most workloads, yes! You pay only for what you use. No idle capacity.\n\nWant to explore serverless for your application? Let's chat about your specific use case!`;
