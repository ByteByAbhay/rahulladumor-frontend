<StructuredData
  type={structuredDataType} // defaults to "all"
  pageData={{
    url: canonical,
    title: fullTitle,
    description: desc,
    breadcrumbs: breadcrumbs,
  }}
/>
```

**This means:**

- ‚úÖ No code changes needed in existing pages
- ‚úÖ Consistent local SEO signals across the site

---

### **Manual Control (If Needed)**

You can control which schemas are included:

```jsx
// Include only LocalBusiness schema
<MetaHead seo={seo} structuredDataType="localbusiness" />

// Include all schemas (default)
<MetaHead seo={seo} structuredDataType="all" />

// Exclude structured data entirely
<MetaHead seo={seo} includeStructuredData={false} />
