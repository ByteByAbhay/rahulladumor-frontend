# VNSGU Event Implementation - Complete Documentation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a static SEO-optimized event page for the VNSGU University guest lecture with separate events configuration file and CDN integration.

## What Was Done

### ✅ 1. Created Separate Events Config File
**File:** `config/eventsConfig.js`

- Moved all speaking events data from `personalInfo.js` to dedicated config
- Added CDN domain integration with environment variable support
- Includes VNSGU event with complete details:
  - Event metadata (date, location, venue, audience)
  - 6 key takeaways about serverless benefits
  - 6 technologies covered
  - 5 event photos in gallery
  - 5 event highlights
  - Presentation slides link

**Helper Functions:**
```javascript
getEventBySlug(slug)        // Get single event by slug
getFeaturedEvents()          // Get all featured events
getEventsByType(type)        // Filter by event type
getEventTypes()              // Get unique event types
```

### ✅ 2. Created Static Event Page
**File:** `pages/events/vnsgu-serverless-development.jsx`

**Features:**
- **SEO Optimized:**
  - Comprehensive meta tags
  - Structured keywords (15+ relevant terms)
  - Open Graph tags for social sharing
  - Canonical URL
  
- **Hero Section:**
  - Full-width event image
  - Event type and featured badges
  - Complete event details (date, location, audience, duration)
  
- **Main Content:**
  - About the lecture section
  - "What is Serverless?" highlighted section
  - Key benefits with checkmarks
  - Event highlights list
  - Technologies covered tags
  - Photo gallery (5 images with modal view)
  - Download presentation slides
  
- **Sticky Sidebar:**
  - Event details card (always visible)
  - Speaker profile card
  - Social sharing buttons (Twitter, LinkedIn, Copy link)
  - "Book Me to Speak" CTA
  
- **Interactive Features:**
  - Image gallery with modal lightbox
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Social sharing functionality
  - Copy link to clipboard
  - Responsive design

### ✅ 3. Updated Environment Variables
**File:** `.env.example`

Added CDN domain configuration:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_DOMAIN=https://d3r07edv7sh3j9.cloudfront.net
```

**Usage in Code:**
```javascript
image: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_DOMAIN}/images/events/vnsgu/vnsgu-event-1.jpeg`
```

### ✅ 4. Removed Old Dynamic Routing
- Kept `pages/events/[slug].jsx` for potential future events
- VNSGU event uses static page at `/events/vnsgu-serverless-development`
- Static page provides better SEO and performance

### ✅ 5. Updated All Components

**CredentialsSection.jsx:**
- Imports `speakingEvents` from `eventsConfig`
- Displays first 3 events on home page
- Links to static page if `staticPage` property exists

**events.jsx (Listing Page):**
- Imports from `eventsConfig` instead of `personalInfo`
- Uses helper functions (`getEventTypes`)
- Routes to `staticPage` or falls back to slug

**vnsgu-serverless-development.jsx:**
- Uses `getEventBySlug()` helper
- Imports `personalInfo` only for speaker details
- Sticky sidebar with all cards grouped

### ✅ 6. Removed from personalInfo.js
- Removed `speakingEvents` array from personalInfo
- Keeps personalInfo focused on profile data
- Events now in dedicated config file
